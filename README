Small test programs for the graph theory lecture by Maria Axenovich at KIT.

Prerequisites:
  - C++ compiler with C++11 support (g++ used in Makefile, modify the compiler
    if necessary.)
  - make

Build:
  make

Programs:
  - ./word_graph creates the word graph for a dictionary file and analyses
    its connected components
  - ./gen generates special graphs in TGF format
  - ./check reads a graph in TGF format and determines its properties

Examples:
  - './gen KG5,2 | ./check' determines the diameter, girth, ... of the Petersen
    graph
  - './word_graph 5 < dict/2of12.txt' determines the connected components of the
    word graph with words of length 5 given by the dictionary 2of12.txt.
